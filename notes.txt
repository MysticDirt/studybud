Django notes:
use python -m venv instead of virtualenv
the name of the virtual environment is now env

superuser: admin admin
test user: tim timtimtim
test user: eric ericeric
test user: tom tomtomtom
(database isnt uploaded but this file is)

I did not add the final user changes because bad practice. We might as well have a one to one profile user and store the metadata there
This was all from a Django tutorial:

This was to learn Django for future projects. Stay tuned for those
